# COP - OOP Program Beta

## Description:
Implementations:
* Interfaces
* Abstract Classes
* Enums
* Concrete Classes
* Static Variables and Methods
* ArrayLists
* Generics 

Using the above we created a program that holds information of different multimedia products such as movie and audio players and displays them. The program also keeps track of how many products are made and automatically gives them a serial number.

## Installation:
Hit the "Clone/Download" button on Github, start a new Java project in your favorite IDE, and drag and drop the files into the "src" folder. Hit debug/run and tadaaa

## Usage:
In the Main class the user can send objects of classes derived from abstract class Product as arguments into an object of CollectionTest. As of now CollectionTest can only take in two objects of AudioPlayer and MoviePlayer. When making these objects the user can define the specificaitions of each product. MoviePlayer requires the user to also create an object of Screen within its declaration since movie players require screens afterall.
After this the user can use the method "printStuff" found in CollectionTest to print out a description of the object just created.
